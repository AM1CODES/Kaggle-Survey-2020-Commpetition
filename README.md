# Kaggle-Survey-2020-Commpetition

The code in this Repo is submission for the annual Kaggle ML & DS survey Competition.

# Our goal
In this competition we were given the data of the annual survey that Kaggle conducts every year and we were asked to explore this data and come up with some conclusions that might be unique and wouldn't be visible if we just glanced through the data. <br>

I performed EDA on the data on features like - Age of a person, the country they live in, The Language they use to code, the IDEs they preder, their job titles and much more. After exploration we were able to come up with some conclusions which i have mentioned at the end of my notebook. <br>
